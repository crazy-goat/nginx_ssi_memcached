2. **Provide Details:** 
   - Describe the vulnerability in detail, including any steps to reproduce it if possible.
   - If you have a proposed solution or workaround, feel free to include it.

3. **Security Disclosure:**

   - If you would like, you can request to be credited for discovering the vulnerability. If so, please let us know how you'd like to be acknowledged (e.g., name, username, or anonymously).

4. **Responsible Disclosure:**
